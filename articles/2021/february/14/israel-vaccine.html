					<p class="articleContent">
						Israel’s COVID-19 vaccination roll out has shown to
						significantly reduce infection rates inside of the
						country. The reduction has been found to be most
						significant within older people, and areas where they’ve
						made the most effort to roll out vaccinations. This
						suggests that it is the vaccine and not the country’s
						current lockdown taking effect. Israeli Ministry of
						Health figures show that only 531 over-60s, out of
						almost 750,000 fully vaccinated tested positive for
						coronavirus (0.07%), with far fewer becoming
						hospitalised with moderate to critical disease. Only 38
						people have been hospitalised, a tiny proportion.
						<br /><br />

							class="articleImage rounded mb-5"
						/>
						<br /><br />

						However, while more than a quarter of Israel’s
						population of 9 million have received at least 1 dose,
						the Palestinian Territories remain significantly behind.
						<br /><br />

						The Palestinian Ministry of Health - which operates in
						the West Bank - said in a statement that they are doing
						deals with four companies that will provide enough
						vaccine for 70% of its people, although it's not clear
						when they will arrive. <br /><br />

						A delivery of 5,000 Russian-made vaccine doses is also
						expected, in addition to the 5,000 doses which Israel
						says it is giving to the Palestinians. There have also
						been reports of Hamas getting vaccines from the Gulf
						state of Qatar. <br /><br />

						The United Nations (UN) human rights body has released a
						statement saying it's Israel's responsibility to provide
						equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines for Palestinians
						in Gaza and the West Bank. This is due to international
						law laid out by the Geneva Conventions, regulating
						occupied territories. <br /><br />

						However, the Israeli health minister, Yuli Edelstein,
						told the BBC: "We can also look into the so-called Oslo
						agreements where it says loud and clear that the
						Palestinians have to take care of their own health.”
						<br /><br />

						Experts say the fourth Geneva Convention is specific
						about the duty of the occupying power to provide
						healthcare, but Israel often argues it isn't technically
						occupying the West Bank and Gaza. <br /><br />

						Israel has imposed a blockade on the Palestinian
						Territories Which has left the territories economically
						crippled, with no available electricity for half of the
						day and without proper healthcare to help its civilians.
						As Israel patrols the waters outside of the Gaza Strip
						to make sure that items can’t be smuggled through its
						blockade, the only places Palestine can get support from
						are its borders with Egypt and through illegal tunnels.
						<br /><br />

						As Palestine is left with barely any choices but to rely
						on Israel to have the ability to vaccinate all of it’s
						people, some people may think it’s unfair that Israel
						prioritises itself over Palestine for its vaccine
						response. <br /><br />
