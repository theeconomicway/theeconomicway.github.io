		<h1>Israel's Vaccine Response</h1><br />

		<p>
			Israel’s COVID-19 vaccination roll out has shown to significantly
			reduce infection rates inside of the country. The reduction has been
			found to be most significant within older people, and areas where
			they’ve made the most effort to roll out vaccinations. This suggests
			that it is the vaccine and not the country’s current lockdown taking
			effect. Israeli Ministry of Health figures show that only 531
			over-60s, out of almost 750,000 fully vaccinated tested positive for
			coronavirus (0.07%), with far fewer becoming hospitalised with
			moderate to critical disease. Only 38 people have been hospitalised,
			a tiny proportion. <br />

			However, while more than a quarter of Israel’s population of 9
			million have received at least 1 dose, the Palestinian Territories
			remain significantly behind. <br />

			The Palestinian Ministry of Health - which operates in the West Bank
			- said in a statement that they are doing deals with four companies
			that will provide enough vaccine for 70% of its people, although
			it's not clear when they will arrive. <br />

			A delivery of 5,000 Russian-made vaccine doses is also expected, in
			addition to the 5,000 doses which Israel says it is giving to the
			Palestinians. There have also been reports of Hamas getting vaccines
			from the Gulf state of Qatar. <br />

			The United Nations (UN) human rights body has released a statement
			saying it's Israel's responsibility to provide equitable access to
			Covid-19 vaccines for Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. This
			is due to international law laid out by the Geneva Conventions,
			regulating occupied territories. <br />

			However, the Israeli health minister, Yuli Edelstein, told the BBC:
			"We can also look into the so-called Oslo agreements where it says
			loud and clear that the Palestinians have to take care of their own
			health.” <br />

			Experts say the fourth Geneva Convention is specific about the duty
			of the occupying power to provide healthcare, but Israel often
			argues it isn't technically occupying the West Bank and Gaza. <br />

			Israel has imposed a blockade on the Palestinian Territories Which
			has left the territories economically crippled, with no available
			electricity for half of the day and without proper healthcare to
			help its civilians. As Israel patrols the waters outside of the Gaza
			Strip to make sure that items can’t be smuggled through its
			blockade, the only places Palestine can get support from are its
			borders with Egypt and through illegal tunnels. <br />

			As Palestine is left with barely any choices but to rely on Israel
			to have the ability to vaccinate all of it’s people, some people may
			think it’s unfair that Israel prioritises itself over Palestine for
			its vaccine response. <br />
