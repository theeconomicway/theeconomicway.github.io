					<p class="articleContent">
						Right now Myanmar, also known as Burma, is in a state of
						turmoil.<br /><br />
						The military, led by the new leader, Min Aung Hlaing,
						declared a one-year state of emergency on the 1st
						February when they staged a coup d’etat and overthrew
						the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu
						Kyi and her party, the NLD (National League for
						Democracy).<br /><br />
						It is believed that Mrs Suu Kyi is being held under
						house arrest. The EU, UN, US and UK have condemned the
						takeover. President Biden threatened to reinstate
						sanctions on Myanmar.<br /><br />
						China opposes international intervention and has called
						for all sides to resolve differences. The state Xinhua
						news agency called it a cabinet reshuffle. Other
						Southeast Asian nations, including Cambodia, Thailand
						and the Philippines have called it an internal
						matter.<br /><br /><br />

						For many years, Aung San Suu Kyi was seen as a global
						icon of human rights and democracy. She won the Nobel
						Peace Prize in 1991, whilst under house arrest.<br />
						In 2015, she and her party, the NLD, won Myanmar’s first
						democratic election<br /><br />
						for 25 years. She was the de facto leader of Myanmar
						until the 1st February when she was ousted from power by
						the military.<br /><br />
						She was in detention from 1989 until 2010 and her
						struggle for democracy in Myanmar made her an
						international figure of democracy.<br /><br />
						She is not actually the president as the Myanmar
						constitution forbids this due to the fact that she has
						children who are foreign nationals.<br /><br />
						Her official title is State Counsellor but she maintains
						a close relationship with the president (until the
						coup), Win Myint.<br /><br />
						She won around 80% of the vote in the 2020 election,
						which many claim was riddled with fraud. In the past few
						years, her leadership has been defined by her refusal to
						condemn the military crackdown of Rohingya Muslims in
						Rakhine state.<br /><br />
						In 2020, 30 years after she was awarded the Nobel Peace
						Prize, she was defending her nation at the International
						Court of Justice in The Hague following accusations of
						genocide. Aung San Suu Kyi may have destroyed her
						international reputation, but The Lady, as she is known,
						still remains hugely popular.<br /><br /> </p
