			Right now Myanmar, also known as Burma, is in a state of turmoil.<br />
			The military, led by the new leader, Min Aung Hlaing, declared a
			one-year state of emergency on the 1st February when they staged a
			coup d’etat and overthrew the democratically elected government of
			Aung San Suu Kyi and her party, the NLD (National League for
			Democracy).<br />
			It is believed that Mrs Suu Kyi is being held under house arrest.
			The EU, UN, US and UK have condemned the takeover. President Biden
			threatened to reinstate sanctions on Myanmar.<br />
			China opposes international intervention and has called for all
			sides to resolve differences. The state Xinhua news agency called it
			a cabinet reshuffle. Other Southeast Asian nations, including
			Cambodia, Thailand and the Philippines have called it an internal
			matter.<br />

			For many years, Aung San Suu Kyi was seen as a global icon of human
			rights and democracy. She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, whilst
			under house arrest.<br />
			In 2015, she and her party, the NLD, won Myanmar’s first democratic
			election<br />
			for 25 years. She was the de facto leader of Myanmar until the 1st
			February when she was ousted from power by the military.<br />
			She was in detention from 1989 until 2010 and her struggle for
			democracy in Myanmar made her an international figure of
			democracy.<br />
			She is not actually the president as the Myanmar constitution
			forbids this due to the fact that she has children who are foreign
			nationals.<br />
			Her official title is State Counsellor but she maintains a close
			relationship with the president (until the coup), Win Myint.<br />
			She won around 80% of the vote in the 2020 election, which many
			claim was riddled with fraud. In the past few years, her leadership
			has been defined by her refusal to condemn the military crackdown of
			Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state.<br />
			In 2020, 30 years after she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, she
			was defending her nation at the International Court of Justice in
			The Hague following accusations of genocide. Aung San Suu Kyi may
			have destroyed her international reputation, but The Lady, as she is
			known, still remains hugely popular.<br />
