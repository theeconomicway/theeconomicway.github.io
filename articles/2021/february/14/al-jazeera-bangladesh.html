		<h2>Introduction</h2>

		Al Jazeera’s investigation team have uncovered a secret at the heart of
		the Government of Bangladesh.<br />
		They have uncovered the Ahmed Clan, a crime family at the centre of
		power. The clan includes 3 convicted killers, at least 1 who was a
		personal bodyguard to the current Prime Minister,<br />
		Sheikh Hasina. The investigation reveals how the current head of the
		Bangladesh army keeps his fugitive brothers safe and helps them get
		rich. The army chief helps the prime minister<br />
		pursue absolute power and attempt to remove the opposition. The Ahmed
		Clan has said that it has the tools of the state at its disposal, and
		can use it to abduct rivals and earn millions in bribes. It has also
		been uncovered that<br />
		the country secretly buys spyware from Israel, a country that it does
		not recognise, and holders of the Bangladesh passport cannot visit. The
		spyware is incredibly invasive and can intercept calls and SMS messages,
		which can be used to track political enemies.<br />

		<h2>Singapore</h2><br />

		An international conference on disaster management was taking place in
		Singapore. Among those attending was the head of the Bangladesh
		military, Aziz Ahmed.<br />
		He is a 4 star general with the title of “Chief of Army Staff”. Al
		Jazeera’s Eye unit tracked the general’s movements. As soon as his
		official duties were over, he flew to Kuala Lumpur.<br />
		He sent a text message to a contact named “Hasan Hungary”.<br />

		Waiting at the airport are 2 men, identified from police files. They are
		Aziz’s brothers, one is the man Aziz referred to in his texts, Hasan
		Hungary,<br />
		his real name being “Haris Ahmed”. He fled a murder conviction and now
		lives under a false identity. He calls himself “Mohammad Hasan”. Also
		waiting is the youngest of the Ahmed Clan,<br />
		Josef Ahmed. He served over 20 years in jail for the same killing.<br />

		There appeared to be a change in plan. Instead of meeting his brothers
		in public, the general exits using the diplomatic channel.<br />
		The brothers leave the airport in separate cars.<br />

		They regroup at a gated house at downtown Kuala Lumpur. Diplomatic cars
		from the Bangladesh High commission are parked outside.<br />
		The surveillance team watches the property. The following day, the
		general returns with his younger brother, Josef.<br />
		Another man emerges from behind the gates. This is Anis Ahmed, the
		oldest of the Ahmed Clan. Anis Ahmed has been on the run from a
		conviction for the<br />
		same murder as his brothers. He has built a prosperous life in his new
		homeland of Kuala Lumpur. Property records identify Anis Ahmed and
		Mohammad Hasan as the 2 owners<br />
		of the house they are staying at.<br />

		The Ahmed Clan sets off escorted by diplomatic cars. They head to the
		Bangladesh High Commission for the evening.<br />
		At one time they were a small street gang. Now they’re increasing their
		power inside of Bangladesh, and growing wealthy abroad.<br />

		Members of the Ahmed Clan:<br />

		Aziz, the general.<br />

		Anis, the fugitive found in Malaysia.<br />

		Josef, jailed for 2 decades.<br />

		Haris, a killer on the run.<br />

		<h2>Hungary</h2><br />

		The investigation moves to Budapest, Hungary. For the past 5 years,
		Haris Ahmed<br />
		has lived a double life in the Hungarian capital. A former business
		associate named “Sami” spoke to Aljazeera and stated,<br />
		“Haris is a very cold-blooded criminal. He’s someone who would harm you
		if he doesn’t like you. You have to understand that this person is not a
		very normal person. He’s kind of a psychopath.”<br />

		“it all started back in 2014, December. I received a phone call from an
		acquaintance of mine that general Aziz<br />
		Ahmed is visiting Hungary. He requested that I accompany him during his
		visit as there is no Bangladesh Embassy in Hungary.”<br />

		Sami took him sightseeing. The general had a proposal. He asked Sami if
		he could assist him to set up a business for his brother<br />
		who was living in India at that time. Sami agreed to assist him to
		establish his business. After leaving Budapest, General Aziz sent an
		email<br />
		where he asked about the things involved to start a business. Sami
		replied with detailed requirements and paperwork. Nothing raised any
		alarms to him.<br />
		He had seen on all documents that his name was Mohammad Hassan and he
		was not curious enough to check them and go through his documents, and
		as they came from someone with a high role such as<br />
		General Aziz there was no point where he doubted the authenticity of his
		documents.<br />

		<h2>Haris Ahmed<br /></h2>

		Aljazeera obtained the fake documents used to build up Haris Ahmed’s new
		identity. It included a passport<br />
		which was signed by Umme Kulsum, an official from the department of
		immigration and passports who was later charged as part<br />
		of a criminal network involved in passport fraud. To get a fake
		passport, a fake national identity card needed to be obtained. To obtain
		a fake national identity card you need to fake several<br />
		documents including a fake birth certificate, education certificate,
		marriage certificate. Getting all of these documents within Bangladesh
		is committing many different criminal offences. Flying under his fake
		passport means he committed<br />
		offences in all of the countries that he travelled to.<br />

		The documents were sent from General Aziz’s office. At that time, Aziz
		was head of Border Guards Bangladesh, or BGB. The witnesses on the
		documents are both members of the BGB. This suggests Aziz has managed to
		get these men to sign a document<br />
		which is forgery, and a crime. Another BGB officer sent an email to Aziz
		Ahmed, certifying a bank account held by Mohammad Hasan, or Haris
		Ahmed.<br />
		A delivery note shows his role in shipping the fake documents. Haris
		Ahmed arrived in Budapest in early summer of 2015. Documents obtained by
		the eye unit show his efforts to build a new life under the direction of
		his brother,<br />
		General Aziz. He sets up the Bay of Bengal company, with his wife, son
		and daughter-in-law as co-owners. The Bay of Bengal is an umbrella
		company,<br />
		covering many businesses. Most of these businesses open up around
		Budapest and close within a year.<br />

		Graham Barrow is a man who advises banks on how to prevent money
		laundering. He states that this behaviour is very similar to
		structures<br />
		put together for criminal intent. You’d look for any business that
		generates large amounts of cash, such as restaurants, hotels and
		hostels.<br />
		This is called “Commingling”, which is combining dirty money with clean
		money so you can’t tell which is which.<br />

		Haris doesn’t seem to care about his businesses. The Bay of Bengal
		reports many losses, losing thousands of dollars in<br />
		various failed businesses. Sami claims, “He would go out, drink at bars,
		and if he would meet a woman, he would bring them to the<br />
		hostel and they would party. He really doesn’t match a businessman’s
		profile.”<br />

		Sami discovers that Haris’s financial interests lie elsewhere. Haris is
		a middleman who uses his connections to secure deals,<br />
		especially official Bangladesh government contracts. Haris says to Sami,
		“This is a secret I’ve let you in on.<br />
		You can make money here.” Haris wants Sami to help with a contract to
		supply Hungarian-made bullets to the Bangladesh army.<br />
		Haris wants to use Sami as the front-man, as he is General Aziz’s
		brother and doesn’t want to show his identity. He makes it very clear
		that he doesn’t<br />
		want himself to be identified, and that both Haris and Sami will make a
		lot of money. He says, “The money will just come in automatically. It
		will just flow in.”<br />

		Haris finds out that a deal for military supplies to Bangladesh is
		taking place without his knowledge.<br />
		He plans to stop it. He says, “If I can’t block it in a way where they
		come running to us, then my name is not Haris.”<br />

		Sami says, “He would start making phone calls to different individuals
		in Bangladesh. He would bully them in very nasty ways.<br />
		He will abuse the people that he is calling.”<br />

		Haris says his role as a middle man is sanctioned by the Prime Minister,
		Sheikh Hasina.<br />
		Haris claims, “Even Sheikh Hasina has said that if Haris wants to do
		anything, let him do it and we will help him.”<br />

		<h2>Dhaka</h2><br />

		The destiny of the Ahmed Clan has for long been intertwined with the
		story of the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.<br />

		She is the eldest daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who founded
		Bangladesh as an independent nation in 1971. The country<br />
		faces the aftermath of war. There is poverty and starvation. Law and
		order break down. As the crisis escalates, Sheikh Mujib abolishes<br />
		opposition parties. The army stages a coup. Hasina and her sister are in
		Europe. Hasina says, “The ambassador from Germany called and told me
		that<br />
		there was a coup in Bangladesh. The moment I heard it, I felt that
		nobody was there. Perhaps we lost everybody, but we still didn’t know
		what happened.<br />

		In 1975, army officers entered Sheikh Mujib’s home. He is murdered,
		along with 13 family members, including his 10-year-old son. This murder
		was<br />
		“one of the most brutal episodes in the history of Bangladesh” The
		murderers did not spare his family, including his wife,<br />
		nephew and son. “A large part of Sheikh Hasina’s politics is shaped by
		her quest for justice and her mission to avenge the killings.<br />

		Less than 2 kilometres from where Sheikh Mujib was murdered, the
		Ahmed<br />
		clan lives in a sprawling district of Dhaka called Mohammadpur. Aziz is
		the second of 5 boys and was a young teenager at that time.<br />

		Iqbal knew the family and asked Al Jazeera to conceal his identity. He
		said,<br />
		“His father had a low-level job, and didn’t earn much.” Growing up in
		poverty and among political strife,<br />
		the 5 young Ahmed brothers form a close bond, but Aziz stands out. In
		1981 he joined the Bangladesh Army. The other 4, Anis, Haris and
		Josef,<br />
		and another brother, Tipu, turned to crime.<br />

		Iqbal claimed, “They were extorting money. They were doing
		kidnappings.<br />
		They became a gang. They started very small. Then, they started killing
		people.<br />

		They had a specific area in Dhaka which they controlled which they
		divided amongst themselves with other<br />
		crime bosses of Dhaka. They would go and extort businesses. They ruled
		over the area as if it were their personal thief towns.<br />
		Sami claims that they are killers who have caused a significant amount
		of damage to human life.<br />

		While living in exile in India, Sheikh Hasina becomes the leader of the
		Awami League, the party her<br />
		father had left. In 1981, she returned to Bangladesh. Sheikh Hasina
		says, “I came back when the government didn’t want me<br />
		back and I tried to work for democracy.” The Military is currently
		running the country and Sheikh Hasina was placed under house arrest<br />
		several times. There are numerous attacks on her life.<br />

		The Eye Unit has obtained covertly recorded phone calls of General Aziz
		and his colleague.<br />
		The party describes how Aziz and his brothers protected the leaders of
		Sheikh Hasina’s party, the Awami League.<br />

		The clan is feared but also faces vengeance. One brother, Tipu, is
		murdered.<br />
		He was a very renowned gang member and “was a very sharp shooter”, and
		was “the most intelligent among the brothers.”<br />
		It was a time when politicians and street gangs needed each other. These
		types of gangs were involved in extortion, petty street crimes,<br />
		and extracting money from businessmen. But they also acted as muscle for
		the politicians when required. They were used often by politicians<br />
		during moments when it served their interests.<br />

		In the mid-1990s, Haris Ahmed joins Sheikh Hasina’s personal protection
		team.<br />
		Sheikh Hasina has praised his loyalty, Aziz claims inside of a phone
		call.<br />

		<h2>The Murder</h2><br />

		A murder on a busy street in Mohammadpur would define the future of the
		Ahmed Clan.<br />

		Mustafa Rahman is said to be from a rival political party, one linked to
		the killing<br />
		of Sheikh Hasina’s family. Mustafa and 2 colleagues are surrounded.
		Mustafa is rushed to hospital. He gives a witness statement to a
		magistrate.<br />
		It reads: “Josef, Anis and Haris have shot me. Haris shot me with a
		licenced gun. Josef took the pistol from my waist and shot me in the
		stomach with it. The others also had pistols<br />
		in their hands and shot at random. I was shot 9 times.“<br />

		5 days later, he died.<br />

		With his testimony, he became the key witness at his own murder
		trial.<br />
		One month after his murder, Sheikh Hasina becomes the new Prime Minister
		of Bangladesh.<br />
		The 3 Ahmed brothers are charged with murder. 8 years later, when Hasina
		is no longer in power, they are convicted.<br />
		Josef is sentenced to death. Anis and Haris are sentenced to life
		imprisonment, but they’re already on the run.<br />
		They were hidden for 15 years until the Aljazeera eye witness tracks
		them down.<br />

		Sami discovered that his business partner, Haris Ahmed, is a wanted
		murderer on an Interpol red notice list.<br />
		He said to Aljazeera, “I feel that I have been used as a tool to provide
		a safe country for this man who established business with my
		assistants.<br />
		I felt that Mr Haris and General Aziz have used me. I thought of
		reporting him to the police but I was fearful of my life.<br />

		Sami tried to cut ties with the Ahmed Clan, but when he does, the
		general sends some threatening emails. Sami says, “General Aziz
		became<br />
		very violent with his words. He became very furious and directly
		threatened me.” General Aziz said in an email, “If my brother has to
		return<br />
		to Bangladesh, the people responsible will repent. They will curse their
		life, I promise.”<br />

		By 2019, Sami had had enough of their schemes, but went on with them.
		Except that now, he was working with Aljazeera’s eye unit.<br />

		<h2>Israeli Spyware</h2><br />

		In February, Sami was contacted by a friend of his who was serving with
		the DGFI.<br />
		4 officers were visiting Budapest for some official reason. He invited
		the officers for dinner. The officers<br />
		said they would have 3 more guests with them, 2 Israeli’s and an Irish
		man. The 2 Israeli intelligence experts decide not<br />
		to attend dinner, only the Irish man and the Bangladeshi’s get out.<br />

		The Bangladeshi officers introduced Sami to the man. The man introduced
		himself as a contractor<br />
		for some surveillance equipment company. He heard them discussing
		purchasing some spyware which lets them do surveillance on anybody’s<br />
		mobile phone. The contractor said that the people of Bangladesh should
		never know about any of it, and that the product has any affiliation<br />
		with Israel. Sami decided to record this conversation.<br />

		The Irish man is recorded saying, “My company is based in Singapore. So
		I am the selling agent.” This man<br />
		is James Maloney, CEO of Sovereign Systems. He continues: “We can supply
		WiFi interception, as well as Celullar, as well as<br />
		video surveillance.” The documents claim that Bangladesh is indirectly
		buying surveillance equipment from a company in Israel. PICSIX is
		founded by former Israeli<br />
		intelligence experts. Bangladesh has no diplomatic relations with Israel
		and cannot legally trade with it. Bangladesh citizens cannot travel to
		Israel. It says that<br />
		it will not recognise Israel until there is an independent Palestinian
		state. This technology can be used to invasively spy on civilians and
		political opponents.<br />
		There’s no doubt that this will cause outrage within Bangladesh.<br />

		<h2>The United Nations</h2><br />

		<p>
			After the Investigation, the United Nations has called for a full
			investigation into evidence of corruption and illegality<br />
			involving the Bangladesh army. Bangladesh military commanders
			claimed that the Israeli Spyware was “for one of the Army<br />
			Contingents due to be deployed in the UN Peacekeeping Mission”.<br />

			A spokesperson for the UN said that this was not the case.<br />

			“Such equipment has not been deployed with Bangladeshi
			contingents<br />
			in United Nations peacekeeping operations,” the UN spokesperson told
			Al Jazeera.<br />

			“We are aware of the reporting by Al Jazeera Investigations
			concerning allegations<br />
			of corruption against senior officials in Bangladesh and the press
			release issued by the Ministry of Defence of Bangladesh.<br />
			The allegation of corruption is a serious matter that should be
			investigated by the relevant authorities.”<br />

			Bangladesh is the largest overall contributor of uniformed personnel
			to UN Peacekeeping missions,<br />
			with more than 6,800 presently deployed in peacekeeping operations
			around the world.<br />
