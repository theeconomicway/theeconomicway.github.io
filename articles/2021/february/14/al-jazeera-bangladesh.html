					<h2 class="articleSubheading">Introduction</h2>

					<p class="articleContent">
						Al Jazeera’s investigation team have uncovered a secret
						at the heart of the Government of Bangladesh. They have
						uncovered the Ahmed Clan, a crime family at the centre
						of power. The clan includes 3 convicted killers, at
						least 1 who was a personal bodyguard to the current
						Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina. The investigation reveals
						how the current head of the Bangladesh army keeps his
						fugitive brothers safe and helps them get rich. The army
						chief helps the prime minister pursue absolute power and
						attempt to remove the opposition. The Ahmed Clan has
						said that it has the tools of the state at its disposal,
						and can use it to abduct rivals and earn millions in
						bribes. It has also been uncovered that the country
						secretly buys spyware from Israel, a country that it
						does not recognise, and holders of the Bangladesh
						passport cannot visit. The spyware is incredibly
						invasive and can intercept calls and SMS messages, which
						can be used to track political enemies.

					<p class="articleContent">
						An international conference on disaster management was
						taking place in Singapore. Among those attending was the
						head of the Bangladesh military, Aziz Ahmed.<br /><br />
						He is a 4 star general with the title of “Chief of Army
						Staff”. Al Jazeera’s Eye unit tracked the general’s
						movements. As soon as his official duties were over, he
						flew to Kuala Lumpur. He sent a text message to a
						contact named “Hasan Hungary”.<br /><br />

						Waiting at the airport are 2 men, identified from police
						files. They are Aziz’s brothers, one is the man Aziz
						referred to in his texts, Hasan Hungary, his real name
						being “Haris Ahmed”. He fled a murder conviction and now
						lives under a false identity. He calls himself “Mohammad
						Hasan”. Also waiting is the youngest of the Ahmed Clan,
						Josef Ahmed. He served over 20 years in jail for the
						same killing.<br /><br />

						There appeared to be a change in plan. Instead of
						meeting his brothers in public, the general exits using
						the diplomatic channel. The brothers leave the airport
						in separate cars.<br /><br />

						They regroup at a gated house at downtown Kuala Lumpur.
						Diplomatic cars from the Bangladesh High commission are
						parked outside.<br /><br />
						The surveillance team watches the property. The
						following day, the general returns with his younger
						brother, Josef.<br /><br />
						Another man emerges from behind the gates. This is Anis
						Ahmed, the oldest of the Ahmed Clan. Anis Ahmed has been
						on the run from a conviction for the same murder as his
						brothers. He has built a prosperous life in his new
						homeland of Kuala Lumpur. Property records identify Anis
						Ahmed and Mohammad Hasan as the 2 owners of the house
						they are staying at.<br /><br />

						The Ahmed Clan sets off escorted by diplomatic cars.
						They head to the Bangladesh High Commission for the
						evening. At one time they were a small street gang. Now
						they’re increasing their power inside of Bangladesh, and
						growing wealthy abroad. <br /><br />

						Members of the Ahmed Clan:
					</p>

					<ul class="articleContent">
						<li>Aziz, the general.</li>
						<li>Anis, the fugitive found in Malaysia.</li>
						<li>Josef, jailed for 2 decades. </li>
						<li>Haris, a killer on the run.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2 class="articleSubheading">Hungary</h2>
					<p class="articleContent">
						The investigation moves to Budapest, Hungary.
						<br /><br />
						For the past 5 years, Haris Ahmed has lived a double
						life in the Hungarian capital. A former business
						associate named “Sami” spoke to Aljazeera and stated,
						“Haris is a very cold-blooded criminal. He’s someone who
						would harm you if he doesn’t like you. You have to
						understand that this person is not a very normal person.
						He’s kind of a psychopath.” <br /><br />
						“it all started back in 2014, December. I received a
						phone call from an acquaintance of mine that general
						Aziz Ahmed is visiting Hungary. He requested that I
						accompany him during his visit as there is no Bangladesh
						Embassy in Hungary.”<br /><br />

						Sami took him sightseeing. The general had a proposal.
						He asked Sami if he could assist him to set up a
						business for his brother who was living in India at that
						time. Sami agreed to assist him to establish his
						business. After leaving Budapest, General Aziz sent an
						email where he asked about the things involved to start
						a business. Sami replied with detailed requirements and
						paperwork. Nothing raised any alarms to him. He had seen
						on all documents that his name was Mohammad Hassan and
						he was not curious enough to check them and go through
						his documents, and as they came from someone with a high
						role such as General Aziz there was no point where he
						doubted the authenticity of his documents.
					</p>

					<h2 class="articleSubheading">Haris Ahmed</h2>

						alt="Haris Ahmed"
						class="articleImage rounded mb-5"
					/>

					<p class="articleContent">
						Aljazeera obtained the fake documents used to build up
						Haris Ahmed’s new identity. <br /><br />
						It included a passport which was signed by Umme Kulsum,
						an official from the department of immigration and
						passports who was later charged as part of a criminal
						network involved in passport fraud.<br /><br />
						To get a fake passport, a fake national identity card
						needed to be obtained. To obtain a fake national
						identity card you need to fake several documents
						including a fake birth certificate, education
						certificate, marriage certificate. Getting all of these
						documents within Bangladesh is committing many different
						criminal offences. Flying under his fake passport means
						he committed offences in all of the countries that he
						travelled to.<br /><br />

						The documents were sent from General Aziz’s office. At
						that time, Aziz was head of Border Guards Bangladesh, or
						BGB. The witnesses on the documents are both members of
						the BGB. This suggests Aziz has managed to get these men
						to sign a document<br />
						which is forgery, and a crime. Another BGB officer sent
						an email to Aziz Ahmed, certifying a bank account held
						by Mohammad Hasan, or Haris Ahmed. A delivery note shows
						his role in shipping the fake documents. Haris Ahmed
						arrived in Budapest in early summer of 2015. Documents
						obtained by the eye unit show his efforts to build a new
						life under the direction of his brother, General Aziz.
						He sets up the Bay of Bengal company, with his wife, son
						and daughter-in-law as co-owners. The Bay of Bengal is
						an umbrella company, covering many businesses. Most of
						these businesses open up around Budapest and close
						within a year.<br /><br />

						Graham Barrow is a man who advises banks on how to
						prevent money laundering. He states that this behaviour
						is very similar to structures put together for criminal
						intent. You’d look for any business that generates large
						amounts of cash, such as restaurants, hotels and
						hostels.<br /><br />
						This is called “Commingling”, which is combining dirty
						money with clean money so you can’t tell which is
						which.<br /><br />

						Haris doesn’t seem to care about his businesses. The Bay
						of Bengal reports many losses, losing thousands of
						dollars in various failed businesses. <br /><br />
						Sami claims, “He would go out, drink at bars, and if he
						would meet a woman, he would bring them to the hostel
						and they would party. He really doesn’t match a
						businessman’s profile.”<br /><br />

						Sami discovers that Haris’s financial interests lie
						elsewhere. Haris is a middleman who uses his connections
						to secure deals, especially official Bangladesh
						government contracts. <br /><br />
						Haris says to Sami, “This is a secret I’ve let you in
						on. You can make money here.” Haris wants Sami to help
						with a contract to supply Hungarian-made bullets to the
						Bangladesh army.<br /><br />
						Haris wants to use Sami as the front-man, as he is
						General Aziz’s brother and doesn’t want to show his
						identity. He makes it very clear that he doesn’t want
						himself to be identified, and that both Haris and Sami
						will make a lot of money. He says, “The money will just
						come in automatically. It will just flow in.”<br /><br />

						Haris finds out that a deal for military supplies to
						Bangladesh is taking place without his knowledge. He
						plans to stop it. He says, “If I can’t block it in a way
						where they come running to us, then my name is not
						Haris.”<br /><br />

						Sami says, “He would start making phone calls to
						different individuals in Bangladesh. He would bully them
						in very nasty ways. He will abuse the people that he is
						calling.”<br /><br />

						Haris says his role as a middle man is sanctioned by the
						Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina.<br /><br />
						Haris claims, “Even Sheikh Hasina has said that if Haris
						wants to do anything, let him do it and we will help
						him.”
					</p>

					<h2 class="articleSubheading">Dhaka</h2>

					<p class="articleContent">
						The destiny of the Ahmed Clan has for long been
						intertwined with the story of the Prime Minister Sheikh
						Hasina.<br /><br />

						She is the eldest daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who
						founded Bangladesh as an independent nation in 1971. The
						country faces the aftermath of war. There is poverty and
						starvation. Law and order break down. As the crisis
						escalates, Sheikh Mujib abolishes opposition parties.
						The army stages a coup. Hasina and her sister are in
						Europe. <br /><br />

						Hasina says, “The ambassador from Germany called and
						told me that there was a coup in Bangladesh. The moment
						I heard it, I felt that nobody was there. Perhaps we
						lost everybody, but we still didn’t know what
						happened.<br /><br />

						In 1975, army officers entered Sheikh Mujib’s home. He
						is murdered, along with 13 family members, including his
						10-year-old son. This murder was “one of the most brutal
						episodes in the history of Bangladesh” The murderers did
						not spare his family, including his wife, nephew and
						son. “A large part of Sheikh Hasina’s politics is shaped
						by her quest for justice and her mission to avenge the
						killings.<br /><br />

						Less than 2 kilometres from where Sheikh Mujib was
						murdered, the Ahmed Clan lives in a sprawling district
						of Dhaka called Mohammadpur. Aziz is the second of 5
						boys and was a young teenager at that time.<br /><br />

						Iqbal knew the family and asked Al Jazeera to conceal
						his identity. He said, “His father had a low-level job,
						and didn’t earn much.” Growing up in poverty and among
						political strife, the 5 young Ahmed brothers form a
						close bond, but Aziz stands out. In 1981 he joined the
						Bangladesh Army. The other 4, Anis, Haris and Josef, and
						another brother, Tipu, turned to crime.<br /><br />

						Iqbal claimed, “They were extorting money. They were
						doing kidnappings. They became a gang. They started very
						small. Then, they started killing people.<br /><br />

						They had a specific area in Dhaka which they controlled
						which they divided amongst themselves with other crime
						bosses of Dhaka. They would go and extort businesses.
						They ruled over the area as if it were their personal
						thief towns."<br /><br />

						Sami claims that they are killers who have caused a
						significant amount of damage to human life.<br /><br />

						While living in exile in India, Sheikh Hasina becomes
						the leader of the Awami League, the party her father had
						left. In 1981, she returned to Bangladesh. Sheikh Hasina
						says, “I came back when the government didn’t want me
						back and I tried to work for democracy.” The Military is
						currently running the country and Sheikh Hasina was
						placed under house arrest several times. There are
						numerous attacks on her life.<br /><br />

						The Eye Unit has obtained covertly recorded phone calls
						of General Aziz and his colleague. They describe how
						Aziz and his brothers protected the leaders of Sheikh
						Hasina’s party, the Awami League.<br /><br />

						The clan is feared but also faces vengeance. One
						brother, Tipu, is murdered. He was a very renowned gang
						member and “was a very sharp shooter”, and was “the most
						intelligent among the brothers.”<br /><br />

						It was a time when politicians and street gangs needed
						each other. These types of gangs were involved in
						extortion, petty street crimes, and extracting money
						from businessmen. But they also acted as muscle for the
						politicians when required. They were used often by
						politicians during moments when it served their
						interests.<br /><br />

						In the mid-1990s, Haris Ahmed joins Sheikh Hasina’s
						personal protection team.<br /><br />
						Sheikh Hasina has praised his loyalty, Aziz claims
						inside of a phone call.
					</p>

					<h2 class="articleSubheading">The Murder</h2>

					<p class="articleContent">
						A murder on a busy street in Mohammadpur would define
						the future of the Ahmed Clan.<br /><br />

						Mustafa Rahman is said to be from a rival political
						party, one linked to the killing of Sheikh Hasina’s
						family. Mustafa and 2 colleagues are surrounded. Mustafa
						is rushed to hospital. He gives a witness statement to a
						magistrate.<br /><br />
						It reads: “Josef, Anis and Haris have shot me. Haris
						shot me with a licenced gun. Josef took the pistol from
						my waist and shot me in the stomach with it. The others
						also had pistols in their hands and shot at random. I
						was shot 9 times.“<br /><br />

						5 days later, he died.<br /><br />

						With his testimony, he became the key witness at his own
						murder trial.<br /><br />

						One month after his murder, Sheikh Hasina becomes the
						new Prime Minister of Bangladesh.<br /><br />

						The 3 Ahmed brothers are charged with murder. 8 years
						later, when Hasina is no longer in power, they are
						convicted.<br /><br />

						Josef is sentenced to death. Anis and Haris are
						sentenced to life imprisonment, but they’re already on
						the run.<br /><br />

						They were hidden for 15 years until the Aljazeera eye
						witness tracks them down.<br /><br />

						Sami discovered that his business partner, Haris Ahmed,
						is a wanted murderer on an Interpol red notice list.<br /><br />

						He said to Aljazeera, “I feel that I have been used as a
						tool to provide a safe country for this man who
						established business with my assistants. I felt that Mr
						Haris and General Aziz have used me. I thought of
						reporting him to the police but I was fearful of my
						life.<br /><br />

						Sami tried to cut ties with the Ahmed Clan, but when he
						does, the general sends some threatening emails.<br /><br />
						Sami says, “General Aziz became very violent with his
						words. He became very furious and directly threatened
						me.” General Aziz said in an email, “If my brother has
						to return to Bangladesh, the people responsible will
						repent. They will curse their life, I promise.”<br /><br />

						By 2019, Sami had had enough of their schemes, but went
						on with them. Except that now, he was working with
						Aljazeera’s eye unit.

					<h2 class="articleSubheading">Israeli Spyware</h2>

					<img
						src="https://assets.website-files.com/5cc6e6e50871f719bb2cc6c5/5ceb94f37a0da86529675b86_PICSIX%20social%20media%20image.jpg"
						class="articleImage rounded mb-5"
					/>

					<p class="articleContent">
						In February, Sami was contacted by a friend of his who
						was serving with the DGFI. 4 officers were visiting
						Budapest for some official reason. <br /><br />

						He invited the officers for dinner. The officers said
						they would have 3 more guests with them, 2 Israeli’s and
						an Irish man. <br /><br />

						The 2 Israeli intelligence experts decide not to attend
						dinner, only the Irish man and the Bangladeshi’s get
						out.<br /><br />

						The Bangladeshi officers introduced Sami to the man. The
						man introduced himself as a contractor for some
						surveillance equipment company. He heard them discussing
						purchasing some spyware which lets them do surveillance
						on anybody’s mobile phone. The contractor said that the
						people of Bangladesh should never know about any of it,
						and that the product has any affiliation with Israel.
						Sami decided to record this conversation.<br /><br />

						The Irish man is recorded saying, “My company is based
						in Singapore. So I am the selling agent.” This man is
						James Maloney, CEO of Sovereign Systems. He continues:
						“We can supply WiFi interception, as well as Celullar,
						as well as video surveillance.” The documents claim that
						Bangladesh is indirectly buying surveillance equipment
						from a company in Israel. PICSIX is founded by former
						Israeli intelligence experts. <br /><br />

						Bangladesh has no diplomatic relations with Israel and
						cannot legally trade with it. Bangladesh citizens cannot
						travel to Israel. It says that it will not recognise
						Israel until there is an independent Palestinian state.
						This technology can be used to invasively spy on
						civilians and political opponents.<br /><br />
						There’s no doubt that this will cause outrage within
						Bangladesh.
					</p>

					<h2 class="articleSubheading">The United Nations</h2>

					<img
						src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/chief-of-army-staff-visit-to-un-mission-in-congo-926643492.jpg?crop=445px%2C0px%2C966px%2C643px&resize=770%2C513"
						class="articleImage rounded mb-5"
					/>

					<p class="articleContent">
						After the Investigation, the United Nations has called
						for a full investigation into evidence of corruption and
						illegality involving the Bangladesh army. Bangladesh
						military commanders claimed that the Israeli Spyware was
						“for one of the Army Contingents due to be deployed in
						the UN Peacekeeping Mission”.<br /><br />

						A spokesperson for the UN said that this was not the
						case.<br /><br />

						“Such equipment has not been deployed with Bangladeshi
						contingents in United Nations peacekeeping operations,”
						the UN spokesperson told Al Jazeera.<br /><br />

						“We are aware of the reporting by Al Jazeera
						Investigations concerning allegations of corruption
						against senior officials in Bangladesh and the press
						release issued by the Ministry of Defence of Bangladesh.
						The allegation of corruption is a serious matter that
						should be investigated by the relevant authorities.”<br /><br />

						Bangladesh is the largest overall contributor of
						uniformed personnel to UN Peacekeeping missions, with
						more than 6,800 presently deployed in peacekeeping
						operations around the world.<br />
