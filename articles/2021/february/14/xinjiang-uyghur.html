		<h1>Shady Business In Xinjiang Province?</h1><br />

		Again and again, Xi and the Communist Party denies it.<br />
		Accusations of violations of human rights, even the US could not ignore
		the sheer scale of the operations.<br />
		Supposed "education" or "re-education" camps, tucked away in the vast
		emptiness of the Xinjiang province in Northwest China. Their purpose?<br />
		To viciously crack down on any Nomad group which does not mindlessly
		follow the unopposed rule of the Chinese Communist Party. The nomad
		group in question is the Uyghurs,<br />
		an Islamic Turkic group of nomads that have inhabited the steppes for
		years. There have been rough estimates of simply how many Uyghurs are
		currently detained in what are clearly concentration camps.<br />
		Estimates have ranged from just less than 200,000 to over 1 million.
		Inmates of the "education camps" are subject to dehumanizing procedures
		that have become almost routine in China. The Uyghurs are subjected to
		intense surveillance,<br />
		religious restrictions (they being one of the only ethnic groups in
		China to actually have a religion) and even forced sterilizations.<br />
		Countless human rights organisations, United Nations officials have
		urged, pleaded China to stop the abuse of the minority, which the US
		described as "genocide". The events even spurred President Trump to
		impose heavy sanctions on China during his presidency.<br />
		According to experts, around 800,000 to 2 million Uyghurs and other
		Muslims, including Kazakhs and Uzbeks, have been kept in the camps in
		question since April 2017. Outside the camps, a total of 11 million
		Uyghur Muslims have suffered under a crackdown decades long.<br />
		Those inside the camps have never committed any crime nor have any sort
		of legal road to freedom: they are not allowed trials, as is often the
		case in single-party communist states.<br />
		In numbers, there are 27 confirmed detention camps, but it is speculated
		that there could be a total of 1200 of them in Xinjiang Province
		(officially known as Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Province, but known
		among many Uyghurs as East Turkestan)<br />

		<h2>Inside the camps:</h2>
		Inside the camps, there are a number of things that must happen for the
		Uyghurs to be correctly educated (although brainwashed is probably a
		better word). Detainees are forced to pledge allegiance to the almighty
		CCP and renounce Islam, or whatever religion they may follow. Further,
		they are forced to learn Mandarin and sing Communist Praise to Dear
		Leader( a phrase often associated with North Korea, yet it is<br />
		more of a supreme Party rather than a single "deity"). Some camps were
		speculated to have prison-like conditions, with cameras and microphones
		intruding into the Uyghurs every move. Others reported that they were
		then interrogated and tortured by Chinese officials. Some Women even
		reported sexual abuse,<br />
		as well as forced abortions and contraception devices permanently
		implanted against their will.<br />
		The Chinese excuses for the crackdown are nothing short of ridiculous:
		Xi Jinping (The Pooh Bear that we all know and love) has proposed that
		the Uyghurs were "religious extremists" and that he was to use "tools of
		dictatorship"<br />
		to eradicate this "threat" to China's internal integrity (some ambitious
		words considering that China has a serious amount of corruption among
		officials).<br />
		This punishment of an ethnic group who have quite clearly committed no
		crime must stop! When the day of reckoning comes, Xi and Co. are going
		to have some answering to do...<br />
