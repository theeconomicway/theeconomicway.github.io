						Again and again, Xi and the Communist Party denies
						it.<br /><br />
						Accusations of violations of human rights, even the US
						could not ignore the sheer scale of the operations.<br /><br />
						Supposed "education" or "re-education" camps, tucked
						away in the vast emptiness of the Xinjiang province in
						Northwest China. Their purpose?<br /><br />
						To viciously crack down on any Nomad group which does
						not mindlessly follow the unopposed rule of the Chinese
						Communist Party. The nomad group in question is the
						Uyghurs,<br /><br />
						an Islamic Turkic group of nomads that have inhabited
						the steppes for years. There have been rough estimates
						of simply how many Uyghurs are currently detained in
						what are clearly concentration camps.<br /><br />
						Estimates have ranged from just less than 200,000 to
						over 1 million. Inmates of the "education camps" are
						subject to dehumanizing procedures that have become
						almost routine in China. The Uyghurs are subjected to
						intense surveillance,<br /><br />
						religious restrictions (they being one of the only
						ethnic groups in China to actually have a religion) and
						even forced sterilizations.<br /><br />
						Countless human rights organisations, United Nations
						officials have urged, pleaded China to stop the abuse of
						the minority, which the US described as "genocide". The
						events even spurred President Trump to impose heavy
						sanctions on China during his presidency.<br /><br />
						According to experts, around 800,000 to 2 million
						Uyghurs and other Muslims, including Kazakhs and Uzbeks,
						have been kept in the camps in question since April
						2017. Outside the camps, a total of 11 million Uyghur
						Muslims have suffered under a crackdown decades long.<br /><br />
						Those inside the camps have never committed any crime
						nor have any sort of legal road to freedom: they are not
						allowed trials, as is often the case in single-party
						communist states.<br /><br />
						In numbers, there are 27 confirmed detention camps, but
						it is speculated that there could be a total of 1200 of
						them in Xinjiang Province (officially known as Xinjiang
						Uyghur Autonomous Province, but known among many Uyghurs
						as East Turkestan)<br /><br />
					</p>

					<h2 class="articleSubheading">Inside the camps:</h2>
					<p class="articleContent">
						Inside the camps, there are a number of things that must
						happen for the Uyghurs to be correctly educated
						(although brainwashed is probably a better word).
						Detainees are forced to pledge allegiance to the
						almighty CCP and renounce Islam, or whatever religion
						they may follow. Further, they are forced to learn
						Mandarin and sing Communist Praise to Dear Leader( a
						phrase often associated with North Korea, yet it is<br /><br />
						more of a supreme Party rather than a single "deity").
						Some camps were speculated to have prison-like
						conditions, with cameras and microphones intruding into
						the Uyghurs every move. Others reported that they were
						then interrogated and tortured by Chinese officials.
						Some Women even reported sexual abuse,<br /><br />
						as well as forced abortions and contraception devices
						permanently implanted against their will.<br /><br />
						The Chinese excuses for the crackdown are nothing short
						of ridiculous: Xi Jinping (The Pooh Bear that we all
						know and love) has proposed that the Uyghurs were
						"religious extremists" and that he was to use "tools of
						dictatorship"<br /><br />
						to eradicate this "threat" to China's internal integrity
						(some ambitious words considering that China has a
						serious amount of corruption among officials).<br /><br />
						This punishment of an ethnic group who have quite
						clearly committed no crime must stop! When the day of
						reckoning comes, Xi and Co. are going to have some
						answering to do...<br /><br />
