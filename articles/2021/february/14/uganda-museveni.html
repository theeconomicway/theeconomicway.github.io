			It does not matter what they really think. It makes no difference
			how the people of Uganda vote. Yoweri Museveni will always win. And
			always has. Museveni has ruled the country with an Iron Fist for no
			less than five consecutive terms. How? It is all to do with how much
			power the Ugandan state allocates to its President. Museveni, as
			president, has historically been able to directly manipulate the
			results of elections(in his favour), as he has made it so that he
			controls Uganda's military, judiciary, and Electoral commission with
			no opposition standing in his way. Yoweri Museveni's rise to power
			came as he served in the rebellions that overthrew Ugandan leaders
			Idi Amin and Milton Obote before he became presiddent of the country
			in 1986: he has been the ruling president ever since. Recent
			Election Some of the things that Yoweri Museveni did to prepare for
			the upcoming elections are more than a bit shady. First of all, the
			entire country was disconnected from the internet(a move responded
			to by anti-Museveni hackers breaching the official website of the
			Ugandan government), and in many parts of the country accusations
			were flinged at the leading president that "they blocked the
			internet to keep the world in the dark" about what actually happened
			during the election period. In the Capital, Kampala, police arrested
			no less than 26 people from civil society groups in the accusation
			that they were using a hotel as an illegal vote-counting centre In
			the South of Uganda, there were complaints that voters' voting cards
			were already filled in to vote for Museveni: we can not know if this
			actually happened, but it is quite likely. Even with the opposition
			seemingly so favourable this year for the Ugandans, primarily a
			38-year old activist Bobi Wine, the supposed "people's saviour",
			Yoweri Museveni still won by an absolute landslide.
