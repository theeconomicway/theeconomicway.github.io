						It does not matter what they really think. It makes no
						difference how the people of Uganda vote. Yoweri
						Museveni will always win. And always has. Museveni has
						ruled the country with an Iron Fist for no less than
						five consecutive terms. <br /><br />

						How? It is all to do with how much power the Ugandan
						state allocates to its President. Museveni, as
						president, has historically been able to directly
						manipulate the results of elections (in his favour), as
						he has made it so that he controls Uganda's military,
						judiciary, and Electoral commission with no opposition
						standing in his way. Yoweri Museveni's rise to power
						came as he served in the rebellions that overthrew
						Ugandan leaders Idi Amin and Milton Obote before he
						became presiddent of the country in 1986: he has been
						the ruling president ever since. Recent Election Some of
						the things that Yoweri Museveni did to prepare for the
						upcoming elections are more than a bit shady.
						<br /><br />

						First of all, the entire country was disconnected from
						the internet (a move responded to by anti-Museveni
						hackers breaching the official website of the Ugandan
						government), and in many parts of the country
						accusations were flinged at the leading president that
						"they blocked the internet to keep the world in the
						dark" about what actually happened during the election
						period. In the Capital, Kampala, police arrested no less
						than 26 people from civil society groups in the
						accusation that they were using a hotel as an illegal
						vote-counting centre In the South of Uganda, there were
						complaints that voters' voting cards were already filled
						in to vote for Museveni: we can not know if this
						actually happened, but it is quite likely. <br /><br />

						Even with the opposition seemingly so favourable this
						year for the Ugandans, primarily a 38-year old activist
						Bobi Wine, the supposed "people's saviour", Yoweri
						Museveni still won by an absolute landslide.
