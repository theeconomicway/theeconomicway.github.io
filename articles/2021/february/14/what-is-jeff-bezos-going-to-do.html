						Jeff Bezos has officially stepped down as the CEO of
						Amazon. He has now become the Chief Executive Chairman
						of the company. But why? <br /><br />
						There has been a lot of speculation over this unexpected
						move and many people are wondering why he made such a
						move. <br /><br />
						Well, he wants to pursue other things as well as Amazon.
						Jeff Bezos has many companies, but none of them are as
						successful as Amazon. <br /><br />
						However, one of his other companies he is looking to
						spend more time and energy on is Blue Origin. This is a
						space travel company (a bit like SpaceX). Mr Bezos has
						aspirations to make space cargo rockets. These will
						carry the necessities needed to live in space. He
						aspires to build new space habitats where people can
						live. During a conference, he explained that people
						would want to live in these new habitats becuase they
						wont be far from Earth and the new places will be
						futuristic and enjoyable to live in. <br /><br />
						As well as this, Jeff Bezos will also be working on his
						own charity, Day One Fund. This charity provides help
						and support to homless people and preschools from low
						socioeconomic communities. Although Jeff Bezos didnt
						sign the contract to allow half his money to go to
						charity, he is still an adequate philanthropist. As well
						as this, he is also working on other smaller jobs such
						as keeping up-to-date with the newspaper compnay he
						owns(the Washington Post) and he is paying to install a
						10,000 year old clock in West Texas Mountain that is
						being powered by Earth's thermal cycles.
