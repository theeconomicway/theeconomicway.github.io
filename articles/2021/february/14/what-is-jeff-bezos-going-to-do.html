			Jeff Bezos has officially stepped down as the CEO of Amazon. He has
			now become the Chief Executive Chairman of the company. But why?
			There has been a lot of speculation over this unexpected move and
			many people are wondering why he made such a move. Well, he wants to
			pursue other things as well as Amazon. Jeff Bezos has many
			companies, but none of them are as successful as Amazon. However,
			one of his other companies he is looking to spend more time and
			energy on is Blue Origin. This is a space travel company (a bit like
			SpaceX). Mr Bezos has aspirations to make space cargo rockets. These
			will carry the necessities needed to live in space. He aspires to
			build new space habitats where people can live. During a conference,
			he explained that people would want to live in these new habitats
			becuase they wont be far from Earth and the new places will be
			futuristic and enjoyable to live in. As well as this, Jeff Bezos
			will also be working on his own charity, Day One Fund. This charity
			provides help and support to homless people and preschools from low
			socioeconomic communities. Although Jeff Bezos didnt sign the
			contract to allow half his money to go to charity, he is still an
			adequate philanthropist. As well as this, he is also working on
			other smaller jobs such as keeping up-to-date with the newspaper
			compnay he owns(the Washington Post) and he is paying to install a
			10,000 year old clock in West Texas Mountain that is being powered
			by Earth's thermal cycles.
