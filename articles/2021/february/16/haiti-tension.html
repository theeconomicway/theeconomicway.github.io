<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Many thousands of people have started protesting</span><span data-contrast="auto"> on the streets of the Haitian capital city, Port-au-Prince, <br>
and other cities. They are protesting against the government, burning barricades of burning tyres and debris, demanding the resignation of the suspected corrupt president <br>
Jovenel Mo&iuml;se. The legitimacy of Mr Mo&iuml;se has been the trigger to the nation&rsquo;s new bitter unrest.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Mr Mo&iuml;se insists that he took to the office on 7 February 2017, however his opposition and many Haitian citizens argue that his five year <br>
term should&rsquo;ve ended on the 7</span><span data-contrast="auto"><span data-fontsize="12">th</span></span><span data-contrast="auto"> of February 2021; because there is <br>
now evidence showing that the result of the </span><em><span data-contrast="auto">2015</span></em><span data-contrast="auto"> election was won by Mr Mo&iuml;se. The one year <br>
delay was caused by several allegations of electoral fraud.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Since then, Mr </span><span data-contrast="auto">Mo&iuml;se&rsquo;s</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Time as president has not gone too well, <br>
as he has repeatedly faced accusations of corruption and been tested by wave after wave of violent anti-government protests. Over the past decade, around $4 billion has been <br>
given to Haiti as a development fund, to help Haiti grow and advance to support the 60% of people that live under the poverty line. The development fund was made possible by <br>
the </span><span data-contrast="auto">PetroCaribe</span><span data-contrast="auto"> program, which allows multiple Latin American and Caribbean countries to benefit from Venezuelan <br>
loans under a system of preferential oil delivery.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Conversely, the president has been accused of taking bribes and acting in a correct manner, and the majority of the large $4 billion sum has been<br>
 mismanaged and stolen by the government. One of the activists said, &ldquo;how cruel can you be, to steal money and resources from people who don&rsquo;t have anything.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Since his administrative team failed to hold scheduled legislative elections in October 2019, President Mo&iuml;se has been ruling by decree.<br>
 On the 7</span><span data-contrast="auto"><span data-fontsize="12">th</span></span><span data-contrast="auto"> of February this year, when his opposition </span><span data-contrast="auto">rightly claimed that his terms should have ended, a coup was organised (we don&rsquo;t know who by yet but there are suspicions that it was organised by his opposition) to overthrow his government and assassinate him, but the plan was foiled. 23 alleged coup plotters were detained. This included Supreme Court judge </span><span data-contrast="auto">Ivickel</span> <span data-contrast="auto">Dabresil</span><span data-contrast="auto"> who had previously been chosen by the opposition to act as a &ldquo;provisional president,&rdquo; replacing Mo&iuml;se. Though, with him in detention, another Supreme Court judge was named in his place as interim leader, Joseph </span><span data-contrast="auto">M&eacute;c&egrave;ne</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Jean-Louis. On the other hand, some local commentators said that the president had organised a counter coup to bolster his position and suppress his opponents.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Jovenel Mo&iuml;se has been heavily criticised about his use of decree to push through policies and his corruption in the </span><span data-contrast="auto">PetroCaribe</span><span data-contrast="auto"> scandal. Additionally, he&rsquo;s been criticised for postponing the legislative elections to October 2021.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The government of the United States, the United Nations, and the Organisation of American States (OAS) have all shown support for Mr Mo&iuml;se to <br>
continue leading the Caribbean country of Haiti until he holds fair elections this October. It is seen in the eyes of many as the best strategy to avoid greater chaos.</span> <span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
