						With an estimated 27 million subscribers, O2 UK is the
						second-largest mobile network operator in the UK. Many
						other smaller companies use the O2 network (GiffGaff,
						Sky Mobile, Tesco Mobile and Lycamobile), making it a
						well-respected provider to choose. However, a study by
						the telecommunications regulator Ofcom showed shocking
						evidence that for around eight years, some customers who
						were leaving the network were double charged some fees
						on their final bills! This cataclysmic error affected
						over 140,000 pay monthly subscribers totalling up to an
						enormous £2.4 million!
						<br /><br />

						In return, O2 said that it had refunded the majority of
						the customers, adding an extra 4% to the sum involved.
						Still, a small segment of former subscribers have not
						been able to be contacted and these funds will be
						donated to charity. On top of the 140,000 who ended up
						paying the mysterious extra amount, a further 110,000
						people were overcharged a total of £38m - but didn’t end
						up paying the bill and weren’t due a refund.

						<br /><br />

						Despite all of the refunds given out by O2, Ofcom said
						in their report that “O2 had broken important rules
						around providing customers with accurate bills and that
						it deserved a fine.”
						<br /><br />

						Alarmingly, O2 had apparently known about the billing
						issue in 2011, but failed attempts to fix it let do the
						scandal continuing for eight more years! O2 were
						“disappointed by the technical error” and they
						“sincerely apologise to the customers impacted.”

						<br /><br />

						Subsequently, O2 changed their billing process and after
						Ofcom inspection, it has been ensured that it will never
						happen again.

						<br /><br />

						Ofcom’s enforcement chief, Gaucho Rasmussen said that
						the incident is “A serious breach of our rules and this
						fine of £10.5m is a reminder that we will step in if we
						see companies failing to protect their customers.”
