             <b> Jaguar plans to go all electric by 2025!</b>

             The Jaguar and Land Rover company plans to go all electric by 2025. 
             However, it has dropped plans to build an electric version of its XJ saloon at the Castle Bromwich plant, meaning the company will eventually stop making cars.
             Overall, the company intends to spend 2.5bn pounds on new technology each year.

             Due to the pressure of climate change, countries are pressuring car manufacturers to eventually become all electric. However, the problem for a lot of car manufacturers
             like JLR, is the fact that making electric cars requires more advanced and expensive infrastructure. JLR will find it hard to afford the infrastructure and it will 
             propose a serious strugle.


  						<br /><br />

  						Jaguar is also planning to invest in hydrogen fuel cell technology.
             Fuel cells provide electric power, without producing tailpipe emissions(water is the only by-product). However, to be fully environmentally-friendly,
             the hydrogen will also need to be produced from renewable sources. As mentioned before, car manufacturers are under huge pressure to produce fully electric cars
             which meet good standards. To tighten the restriction on making electric cars, the UK plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel fulled cars by 2030.
