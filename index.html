 <h1>Uganda's one sided power</h1>
     
     
    <img src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2018-07-27T092844Z_529549394_RC189F5540C0_RTRMADP_3_SAFRICA-BRICS-1.jpg?resize=770%2C513"
 

    
<p>
It does not matter what they really think. It makes no difference how the people of Uganda vote.

Yoweri Museveni will always win. And always has.

Museveni has ruled the country with an Iron Fist for no less than five consecutive terms. How? It is all to do with how much power the Ugandan state allocates to its President. Museveni, as  president, has historically been able to directly manipulate the results of elections(in his favour), as he has made it so that he controls Uganda's military, judiciary, and Electoral commission with no opposition standing in his way. 

Yoweri Museveni's rise to power came as he served in the rebellions that overthrew Ugandan leaders Idi Amin and Milton Obote before he became presiddent of the country in 1986: he has been the ruling president ever since.

Recent Election

Some of the things that Yoweri Museveni did to prepare for the upcoming elections are more than a bit shady.
First of all, the entire country was disconnected from the internet(a move responded to by anti-Museveni hackers breaching the official website of the Ugandan government), and in many parts of the country accusations were flinged at the leading president that "they blocked the internet to keep the world in the dark" about what actually happened during the election period.
In the Capital, Kampala, police arrested no less than 26 people from civil society groups in the accusation that they were using a hotel as an illegal vote-counting centre
In the South of Uganda, there were complaints that voters' voting cards were already filled in to vote for Museveni: we can not know if this actually happened, but it is quite likely.

Even with the opposition seemingly so favourable this year for the Ugandans, primarily a 38-year old activist Bobi Wine, the supposed "people's saviour", Yoweri Museveni still won by an absolute landslide.

    <h1>Myanmar – Explained </h1> 

 

    Right now Myanmar, also known as Burma, is in a state of turmoil.<br> 
    The military, led by the new leader, Min Aung Hlaing, declared a one-year state of emergency on the 1st February when they staged a coup d’etat and overthrew the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi and her party, the NLD (National League for Democracy).<br> 
    It is believed that Mrs Suu Kyi is being held under house arrest. The EU, UN, US and UK have condemned the takeover. President Biden threatened to reinstate sanctions on Myanmar.<br> 
    China opposes international intervention and has called for all sides to resolve differences. The state Xinhua news agency called it a cabinet reshuffle. Other Southeast Asian nations, including Cambodia, Thailand and the Philippines have called it an internal matter.<br> 
    
     
    
    <h2>Ang Sun Suu Kyi</h2><br>
    
    <img src="http://www.theworldweekly.com/images/content/cover/Myanmar-Pic-1_0.jpg"<br>
     
    <p>
    For many years, Aung San Suu Kyi was seen as a global icon of human rights
     and democracy. She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, whilst under house arrest.<br>
      In 2015, she and her party, the NLD, won Myanmar’s first democratic election<br> 
      for 25 years. She was the de facto leader of Myanmar until the 1st February when she was ousted from power by the military.<br>
       She was in detention from 1989 until 2010 and her struggle for democracy in Myanmar made her an international figure of democracy.<br>
        She is not actually the president as the Myanmar constitution forbids this due to the fact that she has children who are foreign nationals.<br> 
        Her official title is State Counsellor but she maintains a close relationship with the president (until the coup), Win Myint.<br> 
        She won around 80% of the vote in the 2020 election, which many claim was riddled with fraud. In the past few years, her leadership has been defined by her refusal to condemn the military crackdown of Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state.<br>
         In 2020, 30 years after she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, she was defending her nation at the International Court of Justice in The Hague following accusations of genocide. Aung San Suu Kyi may have destroyed her international reputation, but The Lady, as she is known, still remains hugely popular.<br> </p>

    <h1>Shady Business In Xinjiang Province?</h1>

    Again and again, Xi and the Communist Party denies it.<br>
    Accusations of violations of human rights, even the US could not ignore the sheer scale of the operations.<br>
    Supposed "education" or "re-education" camps, tucked away in the vast emptiness of the Xinjiang province in Northwest China. Their purpose?<br>
     To viciously crack down on any Nomad group which does not mindlessly follow the unopposed rule of the Chinese Communist Party. The nomad group in question is the Uyghurs,<br> 
     an Islamic Turkic group of nomads that have inhabited the steppes for years. There have been rough estimates of simply how many Uyghurs are currently detained in what are clearly concentration camps.<br> 
     Estimates have ranged from just less than 200,000 to over 1 million. Inmates of the "education camps" are subject to dehumanizing procedures that have become almost routine in China. The Uyghurs are subjected to intense surveillance,<br> 
     religious restrictions (they being one of the only ethnic groups in China to actually have a religion) and even forced sterilizations.<br> 
    Countless human rights organisations, United Nations officials have urged, pleaded China to stop the abuse of the minority, which the US described as "genocide". The events even spurred President Trump to impose heavy sanctions on China during his presidency.<br>
     According to experts, around 800,000 to 2 million Uyghurs and other Muslims, including Kazakhs and Uzbeks, have been kept in the camps in question since April 2017. Outside the camps, a total of 11 million Uyghur Muslims have suffered under a crackdown decades long.<br> 
     Those inside the camps have never committed any crime nor have any sort of legal road to freedom: they are not allowed trials, as is often the case in single-party communist states.<br>
     In numbers, there are 27 confirmed detention camps, but it is speculated that there could be a total of 1200 of them in Xinjiang Province (officially known as Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Province, but known among many Uyghurs as East Turkestan)<br>

<img src="https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_08/2340871/xijinping_2bd5eb91cbd72ff8cf470f5bf578b255.fit-760w.jpg"<br>

    <h2>Inside the camps:</h2>
    Inside the camps, there are a number of things that must happen for the Uyghurs to be correctly educated (although brainwashed is probably a better word). 
    Detainees are forced to pledge allegiance to the almighty CCP and renounce Islam, or whatever religion they may follow. Further, they are forced to learn Mandarin and sing Communist Praise to Dear Leader( a phrase often associated with North Korea, yet it is<br> 
    more of a supreme Party rather than a single "deity"). Some camps were speculated to have prison-like conditions, with cameras and microphones intruding into the Uyghurs every move. Others reported that they were then interrogated and tortured by Chinese officials. Some Women even reported sexual abuse,<br> 
    as well as forced abortions and contraception devices permanently implanted against their will.<br>
    The Chinese excuses for the crackdown are nothing short of ridiculous: Xi Jinping (The Pooh Bear that we all know and love) has proposed that the Uyghurs were "religious extremists" and that he was to use "tools of dictatorship"<br> 
    to eradicate this "threat" to China's internal integrity (some ambitious words considering that China has a serious amount of corruption among officials).<br>
    This punishment of an ethnic group who have quite clearly committed no crime must stop! When the day of reckoning comes, Xi and Co. are going to have some answering to do...<br></b>

<h1>What is Jeff Bezos going to do now?</h1>

<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/669103856106668033/UF3cgUk4_400x400.jpg"<br>
<p>
Jeff Bezos has officially stepped down as the CEO of Amazon. He has now become the Chief 
Executive Chairman of the company. But why? There has been a lot of speculation over this
unexpected move and many people are wondering why he made such a move. Well, he wants to pursue 
other things as well as Amazon. Jeff Bezos has many companies, but none of them are as successful
as Amazon. However, one of his other companies he is looking to spend more time and energy on is Blue
Origin. This is a space travel company (a bit like SpaceX). Mr Bezos has aspirations to make 
space cargo rockets. These will carry the necessities needed to live in space. He aspires to build new
space habitats where people can live. During a conference, he explained that people would want
to live in these new habitats becuase they wont be far from Earth and the new places will be futuristic
and enjoyable to live in. As well as this, Jeff Bezos will also be working on his own charity, Day One Fund.
This charity provides help and support to homless people and preschools from low socioeconomic communities.
Although Jeff Bezos didnt sign the contract to allow half his money to go to charity, he is still an
adequate philanthropist. As well as this, he is also working on other smaller jobs such as keeping
up-to-date with the newspaper compnay he owns(the Washington Post) and he is paying to install
a 10,000 year old clock in West Texas Mountain that is being powered by Earth's thermal cycles.

    <h1>Al Jazeera’s Investigation into Bangladesh</h1><br> 
    
    <img src="https://media-eng.dhakatribune.com/uploads/2021/02/al-jazeera-1612236630380.jpg"<br>

<h2>Introduction</h2> 

Al Jazeera’s investigation team have uncovered a secret at the heart of the Government of Bangladesh.<br> 
They have uncovered the Ahmed Clan, a crime family at the centre of power. The clan includes 3 convicted killers, at least 1 who was a personal bodyguard to the current Prime Minister,<br>  
Sheikh Hasina. The investigation reveals how the current head of the Bangladesh army keeps his fugitive brothers safe and helps them get rich. The army chief helps the prime minister<br> 
 pursue absolute power and attempt to remove the opposition. The Ahmed Clan has said that it has the tools of the state at its disposal, and can use it to abduct rivals and earn millions in bribes. It has also been uncovered that<br> 
  the country secretly buys spyware from Israel, a country that it does not recognise, and holders of the Bangladesh passport cannot visit. The spyware is incredibly invasive and can intercept calls and SMS messages, which can be used to track political enemies.<br>  

 

<h2>Singapore</h2><br>  

An international conference on disaster management was taking place in Singapore. Among those attending was the head of the Bangladesh military, Aziz Ahmed.<br>  
He is a 4 star general with the title of “Chief of Army Staff”. Al Jazeera’s Eye unit tracked the general’s movements. As soon as his official duties were over, he flew to Kuala Lumpur.<br> 
 He sent a text message to a contact named “Hasan Hungary”.<br>   

Waiting at the airport are 2 men, identified from police files. They are Aziz’s brothers, one is the man Aziz referred to in his texts, Hasan Hungary,<br>  
his real name being “Haris Ahmed”. He fled a murder conviction and now lives under a false identity. He calls himself “Mohammad Hasan”.  Also waiting is the youngest of the Ahmed Clan,<br>  
Josef Ahmed. He served over 20 years in jail for the same killing.<br>   

There appeared to be a change in plan. Instead of meeting his brothers in public, the general exits using the diplomatic channel.<br>  
The brothers leave the airport in separate cars.<br>   

They regroup at a gated house at downtown Kuala Lumpur. Diplomatic cars from the Bangladesh High commission are parked outside.<br>  
The surveillance team watches the property. The following day, the general returns with his younger brother, Josef.<br>  
Another man emerges from behind the gates. This is Anis Ahmed, the oldest of the Ahmed Clan. Anis Ahmed has been on the run from a conviction for the<br>  
same murder as his brothers. He has built a prosperous life in his new homeland of Kuala Lumpur. Property records identify Anis Ahmed and Mohammad Hasan as the 2 owners<br>  
of the house they are staying at.<br>    

The Ahmed Clan sets off escorted by diplomatic cars. They head to the Bangladesh High Commission for the evening.<br> 
 At one time they were a small street gang. Now they’re increasing their power inside of Bangladesh, and growing wealthy abroad.<br>   

Members of the Ahmed Clan:<br>  

Aziz, the general.<br>  

Anis, the fugitive found in Malaysia.<br>   

Josef, jailed for 2 decades.<br>   

Haris, a killer on the run.<br>   

 

<h2>Hungary</h2><br> 

The investigation moves to Budapest, Hungary. For the past 5 years, Haris Ahmed<br>  
has lived a double life in the Hungarian capital. A former business associate named “Sami” spoke to Aljazeera and stated,<br> 
“Haris is a very cold-blooded criminal. He’s someone who would harm you if he doesn’t like you. You have to understand that this person is not a very normal person. He’s kind of a psychopath.”<br>  

“it all started back in 2014, December. I received a phone call from an acquaintance of mine that general Aziz<br> 
Ahmed is visiting Hungary. He requested that I accompany him during his visit as there is no Bangladesh Embassy in Hungary.”<br> 

Sami took him sightseeing. The general had a proposal. He asked Sami if he could assist him to set up a business for his brother<br> 
who was living in India at that time. Sami agreed to assist him to establish his business. After leaving Budapest, General Aziz sent an email<br> 
where he asked about the things involved to start a business. Sami replied with detailed requirements and paperwork. Nothing raised any alarms to him.<br>
 He had seen on all documents that his name was Mohammad Hassan and he was not curious enough to check them and go through his documents, and as they came from someone with a high role such as<br>
  General Aziz there was no point where he doubted the authenticity of his documents.<br>  

 

<h2>Haris Ahmed<br></h2>   

Aljazeera obtained the fake documents used to build up Haris Ahmed’s new identity. It included a passport<br> 
 which was signed by Umme Kulsum, an official from the department of immigration and passports who was later charged as part<br> 
  of a criminal network involved in passport fraud. To get a fake passport, a fake national identity card needed to be obtained. To obtain a fake national identity card you need to fake several<br> 
   documents including a fake birth certificate, education certificate, marriage certificate. Getting all of these documents within Bangladesh is committing many different criminal offences. Flying under his fake passport means he committed<br>  
   offences in all of the countries that he travelled to.<br>   

The documents were sent from General Aziz’s office. At that time, Aziz was head of Border Guards Bangladesh, or BGB. The witnesses on the documents are both members of the BGB. This suggests Aziz has managed to get these men to sign a document<br>  
which is forgery, and a crime. Another BGB officer sent an email to Aziz Ahmed, certifying a bank account held by Mohammad Hasan, or Haris Ahmed.<br> 
 A delivery note shows his role in shipping the fake documents.  

Haris Ahmed arrived in Budapest in early summer of 2015. Documents obtained by the eye unit show his efforts to build a new life under the direction of his brother,<br> 
General Aziz. He sets up the Bay of Bengal company, with his wife, son and daughter-in-law as co-owners. The Bay of Bengal is an umbrella company,<br>  
covering many businesses. Most of these businesses open up around Budapest and close within a year.<br> 

Graham Barrow is a man who advises banks on how to prevent money laundering. He states that this behaviour is very similar to structures<br>  
put together for criminal intent. You’d look for any business that generates large amounts of cash, such as restaurants, hotels and hostels.<br> 
 This is called “Commingling”, which is combining dirty money with clean money so you can’t tell which is which.<br>   

Haris doesn’t seem to care about his businesses. The Bay of Bengal reports many losses, losing thousands of dollars in<br>  
various failed businesses. Sami claims, “He would go out, drink at bars, and if he would meet a woman, he would bring them to the<br>  
hostel and they would party. He really doesn’t match a businessman’s profile.”<br>  

Sami discovers that Haris’s financial interests lie elsewhere. Haris is a middleman who uses his connections to secure deals,<br>  
especially official Bangladesh government contracts.  Haris says to Sami, “This is a secret I’ve let you in on.<br> 
 You can make money here.” Haris wants Sami to help with a contract to supply Hungarian-made bullets to the Bangladesh army.<br> 
  Haris wants to use Sami as the front-man, as he is General Aziz’s brother and doesn’t want to show his identity. He makes it very clear that he doesn’t<br>  
  want himself to be identified, and that both Haris and Sami will make a lot of money. He says, “The money will just come in automatically. It will just flow in.”<br>  

Haris finds out that a deal for military supplies to Bangladesh is taking place without his knowledge.<br> 
 He plans to stop it. He says, “If I can’t block it in a way where they come running to us, then my name is not Haris.”<br>  

Sami says, “He would start making phone calls to different individuals in Bangladesh. He would bully them in very nasty ways.<br> 
 He will abuse the people that he is calling.”<br>  

Haris says his role as a middle man is sanctioned by the Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina.<br>  
Haris claims, “Even Sheikh Hasina has said that if Haris wants to do anything, let him do it and we will help him.”<br>  

 

<h2>Dhaka</h2><br>  

The destiny of the Ahmed Clan has for long been intertwined with the story of the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.<br>   

She is the eldest daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who founded Bangladesh as an independent nation in 1971. The country<br>  
faces the aftermath of war. There is poverty and starvation. Law and order break down. As the crisis escalates, Sheikh Mujib abolishes<br>  
opposition parties. The army stages a coup. Hasina and her sister are in Europe. Hasina says, “The ambassador from Germany called and told me that<br>  
there was a coup in Bangladesh. The moment I heard it, I felt that nobody was there. Perhaps we lost everybody, but we still didn’t know what happened.<br>   

In 1975, army officers entered Sheikh Mujib’s home. He is murdered, along with 13 family members, including his 10-year-old son. This murder was<br>  
“one of the most brutal episodes in the history of Bangladesh” The murderers did not spare his  family, including his wife,<br>  
nephew and son. “A large part of Sheikh Hasina’s politics is shaped by her quest for justice and her mission to avenge the killings.<br>   

Less than 2 kilometres from where Sheikh Mujib was murdered, the Ahmed<br>  
clan lives in a sprawling district of Dhaka called Mohammadpur. Aziz is the second of 5 boys and was a young teenager at that time.<br>   

Iqbal knew the family and asked Al Jazeera to conceal his identity. He said,<br>  
“His father had a low-level job, and didn’t earn much.” Growing up in poverty and among political strife,<br> 
 the 5 young Ahmed brothers form a close bond, but Aziz stands out. In 1981 he joined the Bangladesh Army. The other 4, Anis, Haris and Josef,<br>  
 and another brother, Tipu, turned to crime.<br>   

Iqbal claimed, “They were extorting money. They were doing kidnappings.<br>  
They became a gang. They started very small. Then, they started killing people.<br>   

They had a specific area in Dhaka which they controlled which they divided amongst themselves with other<br>  
crime bosses of Dhaka. They would go and extort businesses. They ruled over the area as if it were their personal thief towns.<br>  
Sami claims that they are killers who have caused a significant amount of damage to human life.<br>   

While living in exile in India, Sheikh Hasina becomes the leader of the Awami League, the party her<br>  
father had left. In 1981, she returned to Bangladesh. Sheikh Hasina says, “I came back when the government didn’t want me<br>  
back and I tried to work for democracy.” The Military is currently running the country and Sheikh Hasina was placed under house arrest<br>  
several times. There are numerous attacks on her life.<br>   

The Eye Unit has obtained covertly recorded phone calls of General Aziz and his colleague.<br>  
The party describes how Aziz and his brothers protected the leaders of Sheikh Hasina’s party, the Awami League.<br>   

The clan is feared but also faces vengeance. One brother, Tipu, is murdered.<br>  
He was a very renowned gang member and “was a very sharp shooter”, and was “the most intelligent among the brothers.”<br>  
It was a time when politicians and street gangs needed each other. These types of gangs were involved in extortion, petty street crimes,<br> 
 and extracting money from businessmen. But they also acted as muscle for the politicians when required. They were used often by politicians<br>  
 during moments when it served their interests.<br>  

In the mid-1990s, Haris Ahmed joins Sheikh Hasina’s personal protection team.<br>  
Sheikh Hasina has praised his loyalty, Aziz claims inside of a phone call.<br>   

 

<h2>The Murder</h2><br>  

A murder on a busy street in Mohammadpur would define the future of the Ahmed Clan.<br>  

Mustafa Rahman is said to be from a rival political party, one linked to the killing<br>  
of Sheikh Hasina’s family. Mustafa and 2 colleagues are surrounded. Mustafa is rushed to hospital. He gives a witness statement to a magistrate.<br> 
 It reads: “Josef, Anis and Haris have shot me. Haris shot me with a licenced gun. Josef took the pistol from my waist and shot me in the stomach with it. The others also had pistols<br>  
 in their hands and shot at random. I was shot 9 times.“<br>   

5 days later, he died.<br>  

With his testimony, he became the key witness at his own murder trial.<br>  
One month after his murder, Sheikh Hasina becomes the new Prime Minister of Bangladesh.<br> 
 The 3 Ahmed brothers are charged with murder. 8 years later, when Hasina is no longer in power, they are convicted.<br> 
  Josef is sentenced to death. Anis and Haris are sentenced to life imprisonment, but they’re already on the run.<br> 
   They were hidden for 15 years until the Aljazeera eye witness tracks them down.<br>   

Sami discovered that his business partner, Haris Ahmed, is a wanted murderer on an Interpol red notice list.<br>  
He said to Aljazeera, “I feel that I have been used as a tool to provide a safe country for this man who established business with my assistants.<br> 
 I felt that Mr Haris and General Aziz have used me. I thought of reporting him to the police but I was fearful of my life.<br>   

Sami tried to cut ties with the Ahmed Clan, but when he does, the general sends some threatening emails. Sami says, “General Aziz became<br> 
 very violent with his words. He became very furious and directly threatened me.” General Aziz said in an email, “If my brother has to return<br> 
  to Bangladesh, the people responsible will repent. They will curse their life, I promise.”<br>   

By 2019, Sami had had enough of their schemes, but went on with them. Except that now, he was working with Aljazeera’s eye unit.<br>   

 

<h2>Israeli Spyware</h2><br>  

In February, Sami was contacted by a friend of his who was serving with the DGFI.<br> 
 4 officers were visiting Budapest for some official reason. He invited the officers for dinner. The officers<br> 
  said they would have 3 more guests with them, 2 Israeli’s and an Irish man. The 2 Israeli intelligence experts decide not<br> 
   to attend dinner, only the Irish man and the Bangladeshi’s get out.<br>   

The Bangladeshi officers introduced Sami to the man. The man introduced himself as a contractor<br> 
 for some surveillance equipment company. He heard them discussing purchasing some spyware which lets them do surveillance on anybody’s<br>  
 mobile phone. The contractor said that the people of Bangladesh should never know about any of it, and that the product has any affiliation<br>  
 with Israel. Sami decided to record this conversation.<br>  

The Irish man is recorded saying, “My company is based in Singapore. So I am the selling agent.” This man<br>  
is James Maloney, CEO of Sovereign Systems. He continues: “We can supply WiFi interception, as well as Celullar, as well as<br>  
video surveillance.” The documents claim that Bangladesh is indirectly buying surveillance equipment from a company in Israel. PICSIX is founded by former Israeli<br>  
intelligence experts. Bangladesh has no diplomatic relations with Israel and cannot legally trade with it. Bangladesh citizens cannot travel to Israel. It says that<br>  
it will not recognise Israel until there is an independent Palestinian state. This technology can be used to invasively spy on civilians and political opponents.<br>  
There’s no doubt that this will cause outrage within Bangladesh.<br>   

 

<h2>The United Nations</h2><br>  

After the Investigation, the United Nations has called for a full investigation into evidence of corruption and illegality<br> 
 involving the Bangladesh army. Bangladesh military commanders claimed that the Israeli Spyware was “for one of the Army<br>  
 Contingents due to be deployed in the UN Peacekeeping Mission”.<br>  

A spokesperson for the UN said that this was not the case.<br>  

“Such equipment has not been deployed with Bangladeshi contingents<br>  
in United Nations peacekeeping operations,” the UN spokesperson told Al Jazeera.<br>  

“We are aware of the reporting by Al Jazeera Investigations concerning allegations<br> 
 of corruption against senior officials in Bangladesh and the press release issued by the Ministry of Defence of Bangladesh.<br>  
 The allegation of corruption is a serious matter that should be investigated by the relevant authorities.”<br>  

Bangladesh is the largest overall contributor of uniformed personnel to UN Peacekeeping missions,<br> 
 with more than 6,800 presently deployed in peacekeeping operations around the world.<br>
